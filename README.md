d3js-basics
===========

This repo provides a starting point for understanding data and DOM manipulation with d3js.

I've built the demo as static html, but hosted it inside a barebones Node + Express.js app so that I can do remote ajax calls locally :)

To get started, look at /public/Scripts/demo.js and call some of those functions using your browser's console.
